      <p>Dear Aj Roller,</p>
      <p>I am writing to express my disappointment regarding my recent experience at Chick-fil-A. On February 20th, 2022, at 11:33 A.M, I parked in the curbside to place an order via the Chick-fil-A app for curbside pickup. However, at 12:34 P.M, I still had not received my order. Believing that the order had not gone through, I placed another order at 12:40 P.M, which I received at 12:50 P.M. To my dismay, on February 25th, 2022, at 9:12 A.M, I checked my bank account and discovered that the first order had gone through and charged my account. I was extremely upset as I had wasted 30 minutes waiting for an order that I did not receive, and I had paid $12.52 for that order. I tried to contact customer service three times on the same day, but unfortunately, I never received an answer despite calling at 2:03 P.M, 4:21 P.M, and 5:34 P.M. This lack of response from customer service is unacceptable and has left me feeling very dissatisfied with my experience. I would appreciate it if you could offer me a gift card for $15 to resolve this issue. I would also like to receive a response from someone this week concerning this matter. Please feel free to contact me via my email <a href="mailto:cabeckwith@ualr.edu">cabeckwith@ualr.edu</a> or my phone number (501) 916-3101.</p>
      <p>Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Connor Beckwith</p>

              <h2>Writing Example 2</h2>
              <p>In this example I was writing an informal self assesment memo where I addressed the class about my progress while working on the assignemtn.</p>
              

    <h1>Self Assessment Memo</h1>
    <h2>Project: Personal Logo</h2>
    <h3>Date: 2/7/23</h3>
    <p>For this project, I had to make a personal logo that includes some element of my name. Its intended purpose is to represent myself or my personal business. The primary audience for this logo are my clients and potential clients. Since I am self-employed, there is no employer to approve of my design.</p>
    <p>The audience will see this logo in various contexts. One way is as a watermark to mark the work that I have done. Another way is as a sticker that I will give to people who want to support what I do. I may also put this logo on a shirt so that when I am working, people can see that I am a small business and not just a guy who does free work for people. The logo may also be seen on an invoice or a social media post.</p>
    <p>My audience includes people of different ages, races, genders, and who live in the central Arkansas area (and possibly other parts of Arkansas or surrounding states in the future). When designing the logo, I considered the fact that different types of people will see it. I believe that the design I chose appeals to all kinds of people. I made sure the logo is also accessible to people with disabilities by keeping it simple and easy to see with a black color and no fancy graphics that would be hard to describe.</p>
    <p>I happen to know a few people who may hire my business or promote it, and I took their thoughts into account when designing the logo. I knew they wouldn't like the blue color I chose in my rough draft, so I changed it. I even showed them my final product, and they really liked it. For them to see my logo as a success, it needs to be a simple logo that reminds them of my business or my work when they see it.</p>
    <p>The context of this logo had the most weight on my decision-making process when designing it. I knew it would need to go on various documents and diverse places, so I had to design something that would look good when resized to different sizes and on different colored documents. I didn't have any other constraints such as technology or budget. One contextual challenge I had to overcome was the oversaturation of logos that are just the letters "CB," which made it difficult to come up with something original.</p>
    <p>When designing this logo, I kept the digital format in mind as it will be used the most, but I believe it will also look good when printed on paper or as a sticker due to its simplicity. The size I chose is not important because I have vectorized my logo, which means I can resize it to any size and it will still look crisp. The typography I chose is a thick cursive font called "genty." I chose this font because I like the way the letters' curves look and how the "C" and "B" come together at the bottom.</p>
    <p>I also chose to keep the inside of the oval transparent, so the logo can inherit the same background as the document it is placed on. If the background is black, I will invert the logo to white. I wanted my logo to have a transparent background because it represents the adaptable nature of my work. Just as the logo inherits the color of whatever it is placed on, I strive to adapt and change my services and approach based on the needs of my clients.</p>
    <p>The final design of my personal logo is a black oval shape with the letters "CB" in white, written in a thick cursive font called "genty." The oval shape represents adaptability and flexibility, while the white letters on a black background provide a high contrast for easy readability. The transparent background allows the logo to blend seamlessly with different document backgrounds or surfaces.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Overall, I am satisfied with the design of my personal logo. I believe it effectively represents myself and my business, and is adaptable to various contexts and audiences. By considering the feedback of potential clients and keeping the digital format in mind, I have created a simple and memorable logo that can be used in different ways to promote my business.</p>

I was a project manager for making sure certain things were done at an event and I made sure to explain each step very carefully in a way that they would understand and not feel overwhelemed.</p>
              <h1>Sound Checklist</h1>
              <h2>Arrival and Setup</h2>
              <ul>
                  <li>Arrive at station 5 minutes before practice starts. (Sunday AM 8:40, Sunday PM 3:40, Wednesday 6:10)</li>
                  <li>Turn on power rack. (under camera)</li>
                  <li>Turn on the board on the back right of the board.</li>
                  <li>Click on the small mute mics button on the right hand side of the board and it will light up orange.</li>
                  <li>Now you can flip the three switches on the back of the wall in the sound booth.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Things to Keep in Mind</h2>
              <ul>
                  <li>Get the band to sound full. You should always be able to hear what the instruments are doing and feel the music behind the singers.</li>
                  <li>Make sure drums are loud and punchy.</li>
                  <li>Bass should feel big and fat during big moments of the song but shouldn't be a distraction during quiet moments.</li>
                  <li>The track should supplement the band and be heard but also not take over the song.</li>
                  <li>The singers should be mixed equally so that you can hear all three parts but not be able to pick out individual voices within the parts.</li>
                  <li>Soloist should be turned up to be heard clearly during their solos and while leading.</li>
                  <li>Listen to singers feedback to get their monitors right during practice.</li>
                  <li>Pulpit mic should always be a priority. (Make sure the speaker can always be heard and that the mic is "clipping" and distorting.)</li>
                  <li>Volume of music should be good and full but not too loud where it is uncomfortable.</li>
                  <li>If you need to leave your station for any reason, just ask someone who has run sound before to take your place. If it is during preaching, just set the pulpit mic to a good level and leave it. Replace any dead AA batteries in the mics. (Batteries in cabinet.)</li>
                  <li>Make sure that the computer is unmuted before and after church for music but that it is also muted during service.</li>
              </ul>
